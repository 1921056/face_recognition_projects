# face_recognition_projects
minor project of 6th sem


Attendance maintenance is a significant function in all the institutions to monitor the
performance of the students. Every institute does this in its own way. Some of these institutes
use the old paper or file based systems and some have adopted strategies of automatic
attendance using some bio-metric techniques. A facial recognition system is a computerized
bio-metric software which is suited for determining or validating a person by performing
comparison on patterns based on their facial appearances. Face recognition systems have
upgraded appreciably in their management over the recent years and this technology is now
vastly used for various objectives like security and in commercial operations. Face recognition
is a powerful field of research which is a computer based digital technology. Face recognition
for the intent of marking attendance is a resourceful application of attendance system. It is
widely used in security systems and it can be compared with other bio-metrics such as
fingerprint or eye iris recognition systems. As the number of students in an educational
institute or employees at an organization increases, the needs for lecturers or to the
organization also increase the complication of attendance control. This project may be helpful
for the explanation of these types of problems. The number of students present in a lecture hall
is observed, each person is identified and then the information about the number of students
who are present I maintained.The expected system engages the face recognition approach for
the automating the attendance procedure of students or employees without their involvement.
A web cam is used for capturing the images of students or employees. The faces in the
captured images are detected and compared with the images in database and the attendance is
marked. Object detection and tracking are important in many computer vision applications
including activity recognition, automotive safety, and surveillance.
